                    I have created a team called BirlashayliKuz. We were studying in English, Maths, History and Biology. First, we wanted to share our knowledge with others. Soon, our team has welcomed some students and theu were also strong in particular subjects like physics and chemistry. Finally, our team reached 11 memebers.

                <q>What we mean by forgotten culture? It is clearly noticeable that right now, there are tons of IT products all around us. Although they are helping humans in many ways, there are some called sociel media. Because of them, humans are losing their initial tradition. It is good to have sociel medias, but they should not override our culture and humanity. They should come together along the way. Our team tries to recall these terms among society. How? We have books that were written many years ago and in which our culture still lives. We persuade people to read this kind of books and we read them ourselves. If reading finds its place among people, this century can include both the culture and modern world innovations at the same time.</q>
